Visiting UNLV for their Smart Cities 2025 REU Program
Under the guidance of Professor Grzegorz Chmaj

This REU Project tackles Multi-Modal Routing through 
a dense, walkable, transit-friendly city environment, in which Seattle was chosen

------------------------------------------
abc_routes - the 'final' selected routes that will be used for the ML model

colab_notebooks - before any real-world data was collected, synthetic data was utilized through 'trainingtestset_set' Excel file; with the notebooks in there to be modeled through ML

google_maps_api_scripts - a somewhat unorganized mess right now, but as this project heavily relies on the Google Maps API to collect route durations, this folder contains those scripts along with the necessary CSV files amongst them

objectives - continuously updated, go over the problem definition of the project and the 'tracker', of the steps taken so far

papers_to_cite - all necessary papers found during research that relate to what's present in this project

real_life_data - All of the points of interest are present here; this was used to build off the 'google_maps_api_scripts' and 'ABCs_(Routes)' folders
