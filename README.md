Under guidance to Professor Grzegorz Chmaj

This REU Project tackles on Multi Modal Routing through 
a dense walkable, transit-friendly city environment; in which Seattle was chosen

------------------------------------------
abc_routes - the 'final' selected routes that will be used for the ML model

colab_notebooks - before any real world data was collected - synthetic data was utilized through 'trainingtestset_set' excel file; with the notebooks in there to be modeled thru ML

google_maps_api_scripts - a somewhat unorganized mess right now, but as this project heavily relies on the Google Maps API to collect route durations ; this folder contains those scripts along with the necessary csv files amongst them

objectives - continously updated, goes over the problem definition of the project and the 'tracker', of the steps taken so far

papers_to_cite - all necessary papers found during research that relate to what's present in this project

real_life_data - All of the points of interest are present here, this was used to build off the 'google_maps_api_scripts' and 'ABCs_(Routes)' folders
